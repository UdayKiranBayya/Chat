# Chat
A Simple App to just chat with yourself, when you're bored.

## Note:
* This tool is basically made for connecting 2 devices and having a chat with them, in a local network(i.e, 2 devices connected to the same WiFi network, or to the mobile hotspot of the server.), in a local machine itself, and also throughout the wide area network (Internet)
## Usage:
### Just after cloning into the project script.
``` git clone https://github.com/UdayKiranBayya/Chat.git ```

### Get into the directory(repo).
``` cd Chat ```
### Editing the 'config.txt'.
``` nano config.json ```

* Then you will se somethink like this.

### For local network communications:
#### Now quickly provide your private ip address, and a unused port in the json.

#### Note:
* server_ip and client_ip will be same in this scenario.
* And the server_port and client_port should be also same ports affixed by you.

* Now make sure that you're running the server.py script in a system
``` python server.py ```


### For fun communications within a local machine:
#### Now quickly provide the local host address(i.e, 127.0.0.1) and a unused port, inside the config.json as said before.

#### Note:
* server_ip and client_ip will also be same in this scenario.
* And the server_port and client_port should be also same ports affixed by you.


## For communication throughout the wide area networks:
* Provide your localhost address (i.e, 127.0.0.1) at the server_ip section.
* And now provide your forwarded public ip address here, wait don't know how to get a forwarded ip address, it will be done in a few steps:
1. Install ngrok software into your system and authenticate yourself by the software given unique authtokenafter signing in with them, for installing and setting up the software follow üëâÔ∏è https://ngrok.com/download and for usage follow üëâÔ∏è https://ngrok.com/docs
2. After a sucessful installation, use the below command to forward your port 
``` ngrok tcp <internal port> ```
3. Then you will be getting  a forwarded link, where actually your local port is forwarded, get it and run the command below
``` ping <the forwarded link copied before> ```
4. By doing this you will be getting a public forwarded ip, get it and provide it in the configuration file as client_ip. And also provide the new port after forwarding as the client_port.

3. Now get the new forwarded public ip and provide it as it explained before. 
### Starting your client program:
* Now with the same configurations provided above run the client.py script.
 ``` python client.py ```

:) That's it, now n'joy the chatting between your own server and client systems.
